## Description

This project was designed as a study guide for myself and other students of a web development bootcamp as a way to quickly take and review notes on the basics of developing a web page. Through guided lessons we learned how to manage a git flow, basics of writing in HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as their functions within a site.
